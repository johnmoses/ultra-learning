## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The UltraLearning platform is designed using a 3-tier architecture to ensure separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.

- **`./web` (Presentation Tier):** A Next.js application that provides a rich, interactive user interface for the web.
- **`./api` (Application Tier):** A Flask-based RESTful API that houses the core business logic, AI integrations, and data processing.
- **`./mobile` (Presentation Tier):** A React Native application for a seamless mobile experience on iOS and Android.
- **`./docker` (Data Tier):** Contains the database and other services, all managed via Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the UltraLearning platform up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.9 or later)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ultra-learning.git
    cd ultra-learning
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create `.env` files in the root, `api`, and `web` directories by copying the respective `.env.example` or `.env.dev` files.
    ```bash
    cp .env.dev .env
    cp api/.env.dev api/.env
    cp web/.env.local web/.env
    ```
    Update the variables in each `.env` file as needed.

3.  **Launch the backend and database:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    This will start the PostgreSQL database and the Flask API.

4.  **Install API dependencies and run migrations:**
    ```bash
    cd api
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    flask db upgrade
    cd ..
    ```

5.  **Install web app dependencies and run:**
    ```bash
    cd web
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    The web application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

6.  **Install mobile app dependencies and run:**
    ```bash
    cd mobile
    npm install
    # For iOS
    npx react-native run-ios
    # For Android
    npx react-native run-android
    ```

## API Endpoints

The backend API provides the following endpoints:

-   `/auth`: User authentication and registration.
-   `/chat`: Real-time chat with AI tutors and other users.
-   `/dashboard`: User progress and performance data.
-   `/engagement`: Gamification features, such as leaderboards and badges.
-   `/learning`: Flashcards, quizzes, and other learning materials.
-   `/llm`: Interaction with the Large Language Models.
-   `/rag`: Document upload and processing for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

For more details, please refer to the Postman collection in the `api` directory.
